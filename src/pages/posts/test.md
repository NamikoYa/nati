It is pressing, pressing on my heart, pressing me down. The emptiness filling my body and at the same time leaving so much space, drowning my energy. It is as if I suffocate, just inside, struggling with my purpose, my own values about life. This space that fills up my whole body, my whole mind, won't let anything else in. No emotions, no feeling of being alive. I'm not happy but I'm not sad either. I can't cry because there is nothing to cry about. I can't laugh because there is nothing to laugh about. It feels like... it doesn't feel like anything. I'm just afraid of feeling absolutely nothing.
