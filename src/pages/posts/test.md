Dear Readers

Yesterday I stayed awake until very late because I just couldn't sleep. I just wanted to share my thoughts.

It's a pressing feeling in my chest, as if there is something, but whenever you look inside there is absolutely nothing. Sometimes I have that feeling for weeks and  in that time I just don't care about anything. I feel like in a trance, watching myself struggling through my daily life. I watch myself laughing while I can't feel the happiness of the laugh, the emotion that it brings with it. I watch myself crying, but I also can't feel the pain I'm supposed to feel or the relief afterwards. I just feel the emptiness wandering through me. Emotionless. Careless.

And my thoughts won't stop.

Your life is so boring, you do the same everyday. Do you even matter? What if you were just gone, would someone care? Maybe for a while...
