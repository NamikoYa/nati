Hello beautiful stranger

I hope you’re doing well.

This article is rather sad. It’s about a state I experience from time to time and I’d like to share it with you. I can find myself in that state at random, I don’t know what it triggers or why I suddenly am in that state. It just happens.  
 It is pressing, pressing me down, pressing on my heart and organs. Emptiness filling my whole body, my whole mind, won't let anything else in. No emotions, no feeling of being alive. I'm not happy but I'm not sad either. I can't cry because there is nothing to cry about. I can't laugh because there is nothing to laugh about. It doesn’t feel like anything. I’m just afraid, afraid of feeling absolutely nothing. I’m struggling with my inner self, my purpose and value. It is as if I suffocate, it drowns my energy and I can’t escape.

This last for days, sometimes weeks.
