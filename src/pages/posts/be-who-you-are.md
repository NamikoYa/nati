Hey there, my dear readers

We all grow up in a society that expects us to be a certain way. But what if you don't want to be this way? Then just don't. Stop thinking and start enjoying life, right? Well, if it were that easy...

You don't fit, people start to notice. They start to look at you weirdly, start to talk bad about you, complaining. If you ever experienced such a situation you know it gives you a terrible feeling. But is it a better solution to just adjust to their standards and live your life in a lie about who you are? I don't think so...

The ones that complain and point with the finger at you won't go away. They are always there, everywhere, no matter what you do. But do you want to be friends with those who don't accept your real you? No you don't so why do you care what they think?

Always try to look through the eyes of others. What do you see when you look through the eyes of one of them?
