**Hey friend,**

There isn't much about me. I'm just a girl in her 20s with lots of thoughts and creativity. So I created this blog to share a bit about me and what's going on in my head.

Keep in mind, all posts in my blog are written from my perspective with my values and opinions. If you ever want to talk about personal stuff in your life or want to expand a topic of one of my posts, feel free to contact me.

> Don't take me too seriously

It may help you to cope with your thoughts and everyday life struggles but in the end this blog is just for entertainment and isn't professional advice or anything in that direction.

Oh, and by the way for all the Gamers out there, feel free to add me on Steam.
